Use this file to hone the business (or other non-technical) hypotheses you are testing with this project.  Below are some good extracts of how to do this:


HYPOTHESIS DRIVEN EXPLORATION:

## A Guide To Validating Product Ideas With Quick And Simple Experiments – Smashing Magazine

To get started, break down your idea into testable elements. An effective experiment must clearly define these four elements:    
1 hypothesis,   
2 riskiest assumption,   
3 method,   
4 minimum criterion for success.   

THEN

1 Define your customer.   
2 Define the problem   
3 Form the hypothesis   

* IDENTIFY YOUR RISKIEST ASSUMPTION
* CHOOSE A METHOD
* SET A MINIMUM CRITERION FOR SUCCESS (example: “I expect x number of people out of the y number of people in the experiment to exhibit behavior z.”)
* RUN THE EXPERIMENT
* ANALYZE THE RESULTS AND DECIDE ON NEXT STEPS


# How to Implement Hypothesis-Driven Development _ ThoughtWorks.pdf

* The key outcome of an experimental approach is measurable evidence and learning.

 The steps of the scientific method are to:
* Make observations
* Formulate a hypothesis
* Design an experiment to test the hypothesis
* State the indicators to evaluate if the experiment has succeeded Conduct the experiment
* Evaluate the results of the experiment
* Accept or reject the hypothesis
* If necessary, make and test a new hypothesis

Using an experimentation approach to software development

Handing teams a set of business requirements reinforces an order-taking approach and mindset that is flawed.

**Framing Hypotheses**

The traditional user story framework is focused on capturing requirements for what we want to build and for whom, to enable the user to receive a specific benefit from the system.
* As A.... <role>
* I Want... <goal/desire>
* So That... <receive benefit>

Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) and Feature Injection aims to improve the original framework by supporting communication and collaboration between developers, tester and non-technical participants in a software project.

* In Order To... <receive benefit> 
* As A... <role>
* I Want... <goal/desire>

## DAZZA SUGGESTS THE FOLLOWING:

* We believe <this capability>

What functionality we will develop to test our hypothesis? By defining a ‘test’ capability of the product or service that we are attempting to build, we identify the functionality and hypothesis we want to test.

* Will result in <this outcome>

What is the expected outcome of our experiment? What is the specific result we expect to achieve by building the ‘test’ capability?

* We will know we have succeeded when <we see a measurable signal>

What signals will indicate that the capability we have built is effective? What key metrics (qualitative or quantitative) we will measure to provide evidence that our experiment has succeeded and give us enough confidence to move to the next stage.

### BUSINESS STORY EXAMPLE:

* We Believe That increasing the size of hotel images on the booking page 
* Will Result In improved customer engagement and conversion
* We Will Know We Have Succeeded When we see a 5% increase in customers who review hotel images who then proceed to book in 48 hours.

What is a hypothesis?

* A hypothesis is a prediction you create prior to running an experiment. It states clearly what is being changed, what you believe the outcome will be, and why you think that’s the case. The outcome of the experiment will either prove or disprove your hypothesis.

The nuts and bolts: A complete hypothesis consists of three parts: 
* a variable that you modify, 
* a quantifiable result that measures the outcome of that change, and 
* a rationale that connects that outcome to a theory about your customer experience.

If your hypothesis has all three components, you should be able to write it out in the following form: 

* "If ____, 
* then ____, 
* because ____."

## EXAMPLES

* Example 1 (Weak): If we personalize the Call to Action to users who clicked on our poker ad and remove distracting images around the page, we’ll see an increase in revenue on our site.
 
* Example 2 (Strong): Removing the second page of our lead generation form will increase completion rates (conversions) by 10%. We have a higher than average drop-off rate according to industry standards and are adjusting according to recommendations submitted from our user experience expert based on user research.

---------------------- ----------- ----------------------


In General:

* Form your own data-driven hypothesis
* Create strong hypotheses using "If [variable], then [result], because [rationale]" 
* Learn from “winning” and “losing” hypotheses
* Identify the components of an effective hypothesis with a hypothesis activity


# Writing kick-ass hypotheses_ Lean UX Meetup, Las Vegas _ July.pdf

 A good hypothesis is a simple, clear and testable statement, establishing:
 * participants (who)
 * variables (whatʼs involved) 
 * prediction of an outcome (evidence)

## Experiment:

* We believe that [Hypothesis]
* We will do/make [Test]
* We will know the hypothesis is valid if 
* by [Date] 
* we get [Evidence: quantitative measurable outcomes] or
* we get [Evidence: qualitative observable outcome]

* will [do this action / use this solution] 
* for [this reason]
